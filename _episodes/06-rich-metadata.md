### What is Metadata?

It is the data about the data

For example

There are may examples and resources 

Metadata by itself is plain text, in order to be meaningful for the further reuse it needs to be on a **machine-friendly** format. A **machine-friendly** format is for instance `HTML` which can live in a data landing page

### What is a Rich Metadata file?

**Rich Metadata** is a metadata file on a **machine-friendly**  format.

For example:

### How to create a Rich Metadata file?

There are many ways to do it.
- Dataverse and download
- Metadata wizard https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/fair-metadata-wizard/
- Nanosafety https://nsdra.github.io/nsdra-jsonld-metadata-generator-webapp/#


### Where to put a Rich Metadata file?

Everywhere your data is stored.
- In the rot file of your project
- In the data reposiory
- In the Github repository
- In the webpage of the project

Example:

The whole idea of Rich Metadata is because of search engine optimization and semantic web technlogies. In the web digital objects are semantically described, therefore can be found by bots (e.g. Search engines). This is what makes Digital Objects findable and accesible.
