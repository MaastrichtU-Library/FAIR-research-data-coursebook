### 1. What is the difference between Metadata and Rich metadata?

Metadata is the "data about the data". It is a detailed description of the Digital Object referring to, for example, the documentation of dataset properties.

For example: 

In **The Cosmogrid Simulation: Statistical Properties of Small Dark Matter Halos**  → [LINK TO EXAMPLE](https://repository.surfsara.nl/collection/cosmogrid)  
We can see how a data source is described for future usage.  

|Metadata Atribute|Example|
|---|---|
|Descriptive Metadata | DOI |
|Structural Metadata| Data Size
|Administrative Metadata |  Publisher|
|Statistical Metadata | Number of files |

Metadata by itself is plain text; to be meaningful for further reuse, it needs to be in a **machine-readable** format. When data is submitted to a trusted data repository, the machine-readable metadata is generated by the data repository. If the information is not in a repository, a text file with machine-readable metadata can be added as part of the documentation.

> ## Rich Metadata is
> - Standardised
> - Structured
> - Machine- and human-readable
> - A subset of documentation
> > Metadata alone is plain text

There are many examples and resources where you can learn more about metadata. The idea is straightforward: we want to document the scientific data we generate for future use.

### 2. How to create a Rich Metadata file?

There are several ways, but the main takeaway is that you don't need to do it manually. 
The idea is to fill a Metadata form and export it (or copy-paste it) on a machine-readable format such as [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) for interoperability reasons

|Platform for Rich Metadata generation |Source|Online| Note|
|---|---|---|---|
| Dataverse Export Button|[LINK](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/Q80QUE)|✅ | Specific for datasets, it's the easiest way to get a rich metadata file → **RECOMMENDED**|
| Metadata wizard |[LINK](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/fair-metadata-wizard/) | ✅ |A bit slow, but it is tailored to a generic scientific project|
| JSON-LD Generator Form |[LINK](https://nsdra.github.io/nsdra-jsonld-metadata-generator-webapp/#) |✅ |Specific to the [NanoSafety community](https://nsdra.org/), but it can be adapted| 
| Steal Our JSON-LD | [LINK](https://jsonld.com/json-ld-generator/)|✅ |General use. Ideal for blog posts, tables, videos and research project websites → **RECOMMENDED**|
|JSON-LD Schema Generator For SEO | [LINK](https://hallanalysis.com/json-ld-generator/)|✅ |Tailored for SEO, but quite comprehensive|

### 3. Where to put a Rich Metadata file?

A Straightforward rule: **Everywhere your data is stored.**

> - In the project's root folder
> - In the data repository
> - In the Github repository
> - On the project's webpage

Example:


More and more services are using common schemas such as [DataCite's Metadata Schema](https://schema.datacite.org) or [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org) to foster greater use and discovery. A schema provides an overall structure for the metadata and describes core metadata properties. While DataCite's Metadata Schema is more general, there are discipline specific schemas such as [Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and Darwin Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_standard). 

Thanks to schemas, the process of adding metadata has been standardised to some extent but there is still room for error. For instance, DataCite [reports](https://blog.datacite.org/citation-analysis-scholix-rda/) that links between papers and data are still very low. Publishers and authors are missing this opportunity. 



> ## Discussion  
> Scenario:  
You are the scientific leader of project consortia. You just learned everything you need to make digital objects discoverable using rich metadata. You are about to create a project's website.     
> 
> Discuss with your team what is the relation between Rich Metadata files and websites
