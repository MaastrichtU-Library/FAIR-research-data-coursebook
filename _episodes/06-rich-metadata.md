- STEP 5: Create rich metadata (JSON-LD export from DataverseNL is enough)

- Examples:
	- Video o tutorial to export or create metadata
	- we use the metadata wizard https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/fair-metadata-wizard/ to create the metadata of all the digital objects for the research website

- Where to put
	- Metatags on the website (we take the chunk of metadata download)
	- Metatags also in the DRIVE folders

- Output:
	- Link to project's metadata file
	- Link of the digital objects
