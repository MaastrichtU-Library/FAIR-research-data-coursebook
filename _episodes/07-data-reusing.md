## How to cite data when reusing a data source?

"Data Reusing" are activities for recycling existing research data sources. By default, we need to cite data sources.  
The minimum citation elements recommended by [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) are:
- Creator
- Publication Year
- Title
- Resource Type or Version
- Publisher
- Digital Object Identifier

For example:

> Neff, Roni A.; L. Spiker, Marie; L. Truant, Patricia (2016): Wasted Food: U.S. Consumers' Reported Awareness, Attitudes, and Behaviors. PLOS ONE. Dataset. [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127881](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_Wasted_Food_U_S_Consumers_Reported_Awareness_Attitudes_and_Behaviors_/1445199) 
{: .prereq}

Original dataset at **Wasted Food: U.S. Consumers' Reported Awareness, Attitudes, and Behaviors** ‚Üí [LINK TO EXAMPLE](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_Wasted_Food_U_S_Consumers_Reported_Awareness_Attitudes_and_Behaviors_/1445199) 

Nowadays, data repositories have a friendly interface on which one can export the data citation directly from the webpage. Such as ZENODO, Dataverse or FigShare.

> ## Citing datasets increases publication visibility on 25%.
> When we cite a dataset using a standard format (e.g. recommended DataCite), then we allow data aggregators to "pick up" on the citations just like publications. Therefore, they immediately become discoverable for scientific sources

## How do we make sure data can be reused?

Remember that a dataset or a data source is a digital object. So Digital Objects "live" on the web. Imagine they are like fishes in the sea üê†üê†. The way to get picked up by a "fisherman" üé£ i.e. a search engine (e.g. Google), is by describing these Digital Objects with Rich Metadata [(Episode 5)](https://maastrichtu-library.github.io/circular-research-data-bootcamp/06-rich-metadata/index.html). Moreover we can check the quality of discoverability of the Digital Objects by conducting automated tests.

There are different available applications to test the discoverability of datasets for future reuse.

For example:   
In **Google Rich Results** [search.google.com/test/rich-results](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results), you can test whether a dataset is discoverable by other machines (e.g. Google bots)‚Üí [LINK TO EXAMPLE](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1594%2FPANGAEA.750883)  

<img src="https://maastrichtuniversity-ids-open.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/images/07-2.png" alt="google" style="width: 50%">

After testing the URL of the data source, you will get the response from the Google bots. We aim to determine if the Google bots have found a structured dataset with the link we provided.

> ## Following the FAIR principles, you ensure Rich Metadata
> Rich metadata is necessary to be discoverable on the internet. Without testing it, your data can be virtually invisible on the web

If you want to learn more about the Rich Results Test, you can find it here: [support.google.com/webmasters/](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7445569). 

The FAIR principles rely in the idea of structured data following [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) guidelines and formats. All search engines (e.g. Google) and data aggregators (e.g. Elsevier)work with the same standards making it easier to discover datasets. They can understand structured data in web pages about datasets using either [schema.org](https://schema.org/Dataset), Dataset markup or equivalent structures represented in W3C's [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) format. 

When you have a project website, or project folder accessible to third parties, you must include the Rich Metadata format in the root folder for the data source to be discoverable and therefore **Reusable**

For example:

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>This Dataset is a FAIR example</title>
        <script type="application/ld+json">
        {
        "@context":"https://schema.org/",
        "@type":"Dataset",
        "name":"Dummmy Data",
        "description":"This is an example for the Bootcamp",
        "url":"https://example.com",
        "identifier": ["https://doi.org/XXXXXX",
                        "https://identifiers.org/XXXX"],
        "keywords":[
            "DUMMY DATA",
            "EXAMPLE FORMAT",
        ],

            "name": "NATIONAL FUNDING"
            }
        }
