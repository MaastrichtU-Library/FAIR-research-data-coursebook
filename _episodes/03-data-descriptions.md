### What are Data Descriptions?

Data descriptions are a detailed explanation and documentation of each data attribute or variable in a dataset. Depending on the use case and field of research these data desriptions are also known as:  
- Codebooks (e.g. in Statistics or Social Sciences)
- Data Dictionaries (e.g. in Computer and Data Science)
- Labels or Data Tags (e.g. in Crowdsorucing or Humanities)
- Data Glossary (e.g. in Business Administration & Finance)
- Metadata (wrong use of this term in this context)

For example:  

|Variable Name | Description|
|---|---|
|Weight | Weight of the patient in kilograms|
|Height | Height of the patient in centimeters|
|Age | Age of the patient in years|
|Blood Glucose Level |Blood glucose level of the patient in mg/dl|

> ## "Data Descriptions" has synonims depending on the field
>
> **No matter what terminology you use, "Data Descriptions" always referes to detailed explanation and documentation of each data attribute or variable in a dataset.**

### How to reuse Data Descriptions?

Documentation taes time, however we shall always aim for reusing existing data descriptions that are generally accepted in the community. i.e. the variable `Weight` is a concept that has been widely used in research therefore we don't need to redifine it every time.

For example, in [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/) we can find already existing descriptions of `Weight`, these descriptions belongs to a community accepted online diccionary (Ontology). Moreover it provides a globally unique identifier to the description.

> ## Describe your data by reusing ontology terms  
>
> **By resuing Ontology terms or community accepted vocabularies we aim to create a culture of recycling by default.**  
> **Advantages**
> > - We don't have to redefine the terms every time
> > - We get a permanent link to the resource
> > - Since it uses a global identifier becomes easier for others to integrate with different data sources
> **Disadvantages**
> > - Sometimes you might not find an Ontology or vocabularies that fits your variable.

- Wiki https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page
- Data https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/
- Metadata https://www.dublincore.org/
- Dbpedia https://www.dbpedia.org/ so here https://dbpedia.org/page/United_States#
- Bioportal

### What format should it be?

The **Data Descriptions** are normally written on a tabular format, this document has the lenght and depth that the data owner sees fit. The general rule of thumb is to describe the dataset that is related to a publication. Any accsible format like `.csv`, `.xls` or similar is acceptable.  
In case is a databse a data model must be included in machine readible format (e.g `.sql`) and a human friendly diagram (e.g. ER model on `.pdf`)

There are examples where data descriptions are made available in a fuman-relatable maner such as the *dataset nutrition labels* style [(Holland et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03677).

An example is **A Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset**   â†’ [LINK TO EXAMPLE](https://github.com/maastrichtlawtech/bsard/blob/master/docs/img/nutrition.png) 


### (ADVANCE) What format should it be?

- Optional:  CONVERTION TO LINKED DATA FORMAT
	- Using the LDWizard https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/ldwizard-humanities or https://humanities.wizard.semanticscience.org/  orhttps://ldwizard.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/#1
	- Annotate the columns and publish to Triply DB https://triplydb.com/hdezserrano/-/settings/tokens
	- OR DOWNLOAD AND SAVE IN DATA FOLDER (IN CASE YOU DONT HAVE TRIPLYDB ACCOUNT) 
	- Optional: UPLOAD to LOD https://lod-cloud.net/#


	- In case it's an RDF file (meaning that you created your Ontolgy) then register it in an Ontlogy registry https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard or http://bioportal.bioontology.org/
