- STEP 2: Annotate your data (At least the main dataset on which your paper was based on)

- Examples:
	- EU voc https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies 
	- General https://schema.org/
	- Wiki https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page
	- Data https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/
	- Metadata https://www.dublincore.org/
	- Dbpedia https://www.dbpedia.org/ so here https://dbpedia.org/page/United_States#
	- Bioportal

- Optional:  CONVERTION TO LINKED DATA FORMAT
	- Using the LDWizard https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/ldwizard-humanities or https://humanities.wizard.semanticscience.org/  orhttps://ldwizard.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/#1
	- Annotate the columns and publish to Triply DB https://triplydb.com/hdezserrano/-/settings/tokens
	- OR DOWNLOAD AND SAVE IN DATA FOLDER (IN CASE YOU DONT HAVE TRIPLYDB ACCOUNT) 
	- Optional: UPLOAD to LOD https://lod-cloud.net/#

- Output:
	- In case it's a codebook, glossary (README, CSV, HTML) then get the link
	- In case it's an RDF file (meaning that you created your Ontolgy) then register it in an Ontlogy registry https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard or http://bioportal.bioontology.org/
