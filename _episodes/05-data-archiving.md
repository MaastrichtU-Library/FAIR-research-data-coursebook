### What is Data Archiving?

 "Data Achiving" is the long-term storage of research data, including all disciplines of research. The various academic journals have differing policies regarding how much of their data and methods researchers are required to store in a public archive. Similarly, the major grant-giving institutions have varying attitudes towards public archival of data. In general, publications must have attached sufficient information to allow fellow researchers to replicate and test the research.

### Where to archive datasets?

Datasets are archived in **Data repositories**. They are storage locations for digital objects. **Data repositories** can help make a researcher's data more discoverable by search engines (e.g. Google) and ultimately lead to potential reuse. Therefore, using a repository can lead to increased citations of your work. Data repositories can also serve as backups during rare events where data are lost to the researcher and must be retrieved.

Examples of data repositories

Dataverse https://dataverse.nl/dataverse/FSE
https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/about/
https://pangaea.de/
http://www.crystallography.net/cod/

general 
https://zenodo.org/
https://figshare.com/
https://dataverse.org/


- Examples:
	- Dataverse https://dataverse.nl/dataverse/FSE
		- Optional dataverse: In the description in dataverse, is nice to create a rich HTML descriptyion, I'll include the abstract of the paper and the codebook
		- Use https://markdown-convert.com/en/tool/table to convert excel to markdown table
		- Then Use https://markdowntohtml.com/ to customize the description and copy the HTML
- THEN I ANNOTATED THE KEYWORDS WITH ONOTLOGIES FROM AGROPORTAL AND RU ONTOLOGIES
- Link different versions of repositories pointing to eachother

- Output:
	- In case is a not Datverse then get the link
	- Otherwise regiter in Dataverse
