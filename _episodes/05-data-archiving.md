- STEP 4: Metadata on Dataverse (its the description of the resulting dataset)

- Examples:
	- Dataverse https://dataverse.nl/dataverse/FSE
		- Optional dataverse: In the description in dataverse, is nice to create a rich HTML descriptyion, I'll include the abstract of the paper and the codebook
		- Use https://markdown-convert.com/en/tool/table to convert excel to markdown table
		- Then Use https://markdowntohtml.com/ to customize the description and copy the HTML
- THEN I ANNOTATED THE KEYWORDS WITH ONOTLOGIES FROM AGROPORTAL AND RU ONTOLOGIES
- Link different versions of repositories pointing to eachother

- Output:
	- In case is a not Datverse then get the link
	- Otherwise regiter in Dataverse
