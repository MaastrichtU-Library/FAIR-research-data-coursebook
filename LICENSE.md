    "description": "Welcome to the FAIR Research Data Coursebook. This resource is an Open Educational Resource designed in accordance with FAIR and Open Science guidelines. Traditional training materials on FAIR principles often come across as dense and heavily theoretical. Our approach, inspired by Library Carpentries, aims for a different learning experience. This coursebook offers accessible, entry-level content and practical examples to enable researchers to easily grasp and apply FAIR principles in their work.",
