## About üìó

Usually, training materials on FAIR principles are tedious and contain extensive theory. In this Library Carpentries-based coursebook, we aim to teach the implementation of FAIR principles differently. It has low entry-level materials and examples that the average researcher can understand and immediately apply.

Some relevant topics the coursebook aims to address are the following:

- Get to know the importance of a¬†‚ÄúResearch Digital Object‚Äù.
- Explore the available open-source tools for interoperability to make research digital objects sustainable.
- You will learn what¬†‚ÄúData Terms of Use‚Äù¬†and¬†‚ÄúData Access Protocols‚Äù¬†are and how to create them.
- You will review the differences and similarities of ‚ÄúData Descriptions‚Äù in different science fields to discuss what we can do (as a scientific community) to standardize these practices.
- You will learn what¬†‚ÄúRich Metadata‚Äù¬†technically means on the Semantic Web and its relation to sustainable research output for future researchers.    

> üí° **Following a bolder approach, we want to teach the implementation of FAIR principles differently. There is less focus on the theory and more emphasis on examples. Guided by 6 steps in Research Data Management**

> This coursebook draws inspiration from the [FAIR Teaching Handbook](https://fairsfair.gitbook.io/fair-teaching-handbook/0lessonplans/1lessonplan), incorporating various elements and illustrations from [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html). Our approach aims to simplify the learning process for researchers by focusing on practical examples over theory. For those interested in delving deeper into FAIR principles, resources like the [FAIR Cookbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) where you can further explore.
