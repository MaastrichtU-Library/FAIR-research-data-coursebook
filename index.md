Welcome to the Circular Research Data Bootcamp materials!! 🤓

## The Bootcamp 🎓

The theme, **“Circular Research Data”**, is inspired by the socio-economic transition we live through, moving from a linear to a circular model acknowledging sustainability. One of the barriers to research reproducibility is precisely this “linear” mindset. A significant share of the research output produced in the last decades has followed the linear model: 
- **1) Take the data**  
- **2) Analyze and publish it**  
- **3) Throw the data**  

In this week-long summer camp training which will take place between July 25-29,2022, you will look at real-world examples and learn the steps you need to take in your research to close the circle and achieve data sustainability following the **FAIR principles of research data management**

## Learning objectives 📗

– Get to know the importance of a **“Research Digital Object”**.  
– Be able to explore the available Open-Source tools for interoperability to make Research Digital Objects sustainable.
– You will learn what **“Data Terms of Use”** are and how to create them.  
– You will learn what **“Data Access Protocols”** and how to create them.  
– You will review the differences and similarities of “Data Descriptions” in different fields of science (e.g., Codebooks, Annotation guidelines, Taxonomies, etc.) to discuss what can we do (as scientific community) to standardize these practices.  
– You will learn what **“Rich Metadata”** technically means in the Semantic Web and its relation to sustainable research output for future generations of researchers.

## Standing in the Shoulder of Giants ♻️

These efforts are made possible thanks to the [SURF funding for strengthening the RDM landscape on Digital Competence Center](https://www.surf.nl/en/news/surf-honours-10-proposals-in-call-for-proposals-digital-competence-centres-go-to-work-on) and [Maastricht University Library](https://library.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/rdm/) fantastic support.

The content has broader inspiration from the [FAIR Teaching Handbok](https://fairsfair.gitbook.io/fair-teaching-handbook/0lessonplans/1lessonplan), various elements and illustrations of [The Turing way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html). We are taking a bolder and more accessible approach to learn the FAIR principles (more examples and less theory). Still, the reader is free to continue on this path by looking into the [FAIR Cookbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) or similar.
