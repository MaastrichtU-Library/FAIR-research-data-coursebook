# Circular Research Data Bootcamp

25 Jul - 29 Jul | 2022

**Keywords**: `Research Data Management`, `Data Reuse`, `Bootcamp`, `Online Summer Camp`, `FAIR`, `FAIR Digital Objects`.

## Description

The theme, **“Circular Research Data”**, is inspired by the socio-economic transition we live through, moving from a linear to a circular model acknowledging sustainability. One of the barriers to research reproducibility is precisely this “linear” mindset. A significant share of the research output produced in the last decades has followed the linear model: **1) Take the data, 2) Analyze and publish it, 3) Throw the data**.

In this week-long summer camp training which will take place between July 25-29,2022, you will look at real-world examples and learn the steps you need to take in your research to close the circle and achieve data sustainability following the FAIR principles of research data management

## Learning objectives

– Get to know the importance of a **“Research Digital Object” (i.e. DOI)**.  
– Be able to explore the available Open-Source tools for interoperability to make Research Digital Objects sustainable.
– You will learn what **“Data Terms of Use”** are and how to create them.  
– You will learn what **“Data Access Protocols”** and how to create them.  
– You will review the differences and similarities of “Data Descriptions” in different fields of science (e.g., Codebooks, Annotation guidelines, Taxonomies, etc.) to discuss what can we do (as scientific community) to standardize these practices.  
– You will learn what **“Rich Metadata”** technically means in the Semantic Web and its relation to sustainable research output for future generations of researchers.  

## Sessions

On the first day (Monday, 25 July 2022), participants will have a 1-hour introductory session from 10.00-11.00 CET, covering some essential concepts and explaining the Bootcamp format. Then, we will share the exercises, and it is expected participants will respond to them during the week at their own pace at the times they most prefer.

On the third day (Wednesday. 27 July, 2022), the Bootcamp coach will host an online checkpoint contact session between 10.00-11.00 CET. We will tackle questions that may arise during the exercises in this session. (Attendance is optional for this session).

On the fifth day (Friday, 29 July, 2022), the Bootcamp coach will conclude the Circular Research Data topic between 10.00-11.00 CET, and participants will share their experiences.
