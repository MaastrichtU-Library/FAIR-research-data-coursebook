## The Bootcamp üéì

The theme, **‚ÄúCircular Research Data‚Äù**, is inspired by the socio-economic transition we live through, moving from a linear to a circular model acknowledging sustainability. One of the barriers to research reproducibility is precisely this ‚Äúlinear‚Äù mindset. A significant share of the research output produced in the last decades has followed the linear model: 1) Take the data, 2) Analyze and publish it, 3) Dispose of the data. We have the responsibility to change into a circular model.

In this week-long summer camp training which will take place between July 25-29,2022, you will look at real-world examples and learn the steps you need to take in your research to close the circle and achieve data sustainability following the **FAIR principles of research data management**.

## Learning Objectives üìó

Usually, training materials on FAIR principles are tedious and contain extensive theory. We want to teach the implementation of FAIR principles differently. In this Bootcamp coursebook, you have low entry-level materials and examples that the average researcher can understand and immediately apply. Following a bold apporach, less focus on the theory and more focus on examples

Some relevant topics the Bootcamp coursebook aims to address are the following:  

- Get to know the importance of a **‚ÄúResearch Digital Object‚Äù**.  
- Be able to explore the available Open-Source tools for interoperability to make Research Digital Objects sustainable.
- You will learn what **‚ÄúData Terms of Use‚Äù** are and **‚ÄúData Access Protocols‚Äù** and how to create them.  
- You will review the differences and similarities of ‚ÄúData Descriptions‚Äù in different science fields to discuss what we can do (as a scientific community) to standardise these practices.  
- You will learn what **‚ÄúRich Metadata‚Äù** technically means on the Semantic Web and its relation to sustainable research output for future generations of researchers.

In creating this course, we take a low entry-level approach for the average researcher to learn the FAIR principles (more examples and less theory). Still, the reader can continue on this path by looking into the [FAIR Cookbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) or similar resources.
